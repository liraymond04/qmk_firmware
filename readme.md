This is a keyboard firmware based on the [tmk\_keyboard firmware](https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard) with some useful features for Atmel AVR and ARM controllers, and more specifically, the [OLKB product line](https://olkb.com), the [ErgoDox EZ](https://ergodox-ez.com) keyboard, and the [Clueboard product line](https://clueboard.co).

## Setup

Clone repository with submodules and add upstream remote

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/liraymond04/qmk_firmware.git
```
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware.git
```

Install avr-gcc 8 and the qmk package from pacman

```
sudo pacman -U https://archive.archlinux.org/packages/a/avr-gcc/avr-gcc-8.3.0-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz
```
```
sudo pacman -S qmk
```

Run qmk doctor to check requirements
```
qmk setup
```

Set build environment defaults
```
qmk config user.keyboard=xiudi/xd84pro
```
```
qmk config user.keymap=liraymond04
```

Run qmk command to compile firmware
```
qmk compile
```

## Flashing firmware

Flashing options:
 - Hold down both shift keys and press Pause
 - Hold down both shift keys and press B
 - Unplug your keyboard, hold down the Spacebar and B at the same time, plug in your keyboard and wait a second before releasing the keys
 - ã€‹ **Unplug your keyboard, hold down the top or bottom left key (usually Escape or Left Control) and plug in your keyboard**
 - Press the physical RESET button, usually located on the underside of the PCB
 - Locate header pins on the PCB labeled RESET and GND, and short them together while plugging your PCB in

Run qmk command to flash firmware
```
qmk flash
```
